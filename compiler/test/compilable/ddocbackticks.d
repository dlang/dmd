        Closely related to std.datetime is <a href="core_time.html">`core.time`</a>,
    and some of the time types used in std.datetime come from there - such as
    $(CXREF time, Duration), $(CXREF time, TickDuration), and
    $(CXREF time, FracSec).
    core.time is publically imported into std.datetime, it isn't necessary
    to import it separately.
