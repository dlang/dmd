On null dereference check is now available

A new check is implemented for when a null dereference occurs.

This can be enabled by using ``-check=nullderef=on``
What happens may be customized by the ``-checkaction`` switch and by setting a new handler in ``core.exception``.

Due to issues in dmd's backend, not all pointer dereferences are guaranteed to get a check.
