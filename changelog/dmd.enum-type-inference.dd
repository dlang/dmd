Implemented DIP 1044v2 - Enum Type Inference.

The compiler now infers the base type of enum declarations more intelligently based on the initializer expression.
This improves usability and consistency by reducing the need for explicit type annotations when the base type can be safely and unambiguously determined.

enum ItemType
{
    Weapon = 0,
    Armor = 1,
    Potion = 2,
}

void load_player()
{
    give_item(:Weapon);
}
