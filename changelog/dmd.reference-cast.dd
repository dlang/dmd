Add cast(ref T)e as shorthand for *cast(T*)&e

A `cast(ref T)e` takes `e` representing an lvalue and forcibly changes
its type to `T`. It is equivalent to the expression `*cast(T*)&e`.

int i = 73;
float f = *cast(float*)&i;  // reinterprets the integer bit pattern as a float
float g = cast(ref float)i; // equivalent to the previous statement
