Enforce ordering of `return ref` and `return scope` with `-preview=return`

The `return` attribute is associated with the `ref` attribute or the `scope`
attribute. In order to reduce the confusing permutations of the keywords `return`,
`scope`, and `ref`, only the lexical combinations `return ref` and `return scope` are allowed
when the -preview=return switch is applied.
