Mixin templates can now use assignment syntax

Previously, giving a name to a mixed-in mixin template instance required putting the name at the end.
Now, it can also go in front of the instantiation using assignment syntax.

mixin MyMixinTemplate!(Args) myName; // old style
mixin myName = MyMixinTemplate!(Args); // new style
