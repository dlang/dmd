Add a shortened form for switch's case expression using `=>` instead of `:` to make `break` optional, it'll automatically break at the end of the scope.

---
enum K = 42;
switch (K)
{
    case 42 => printf("yes!\n");

    default => printf("no!\n");
}
---

Is equivalent to:

---
enum K = 42;
switch (42)
{
    case 42:
    {
        printf("yes!\n");
        break;
    }
    default:
    {
        printf("no!\n");
        break;
    }
}
