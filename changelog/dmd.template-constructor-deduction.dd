Constructor calls can implicitly instantiate struct templates

Implicit Function Template Instantiation now also works with struct constructors.
Example:

---
struct Tuple(T...)
{
    T fields;
    this(T t) { this.fields = t; }
}

static assert(Tuple(1, 2, 3).fields[0] == 1);
---

This removes the need for helper functions such as:

---
auto tuple(T...)(T args) => Tuple!T(args);
---
