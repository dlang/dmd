Adds the with-colon statement.

Like at the global declarations level, a `with (expression) :` can be used to create
a scope until a `}` is encountered.

---
{
    with (E):
       statement;
       statement;
}
---

which is equivalent to:

---
{
    with (E)
    {
       statement;
       statement;
    }
}
