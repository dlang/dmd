Allow some forms of printf calls to be treated as @safe

`printf` function calls in general are unsafe. Most calls, however, are safe.
This change examines the format string to `printf` and allows format strings
that do not include `s` formats to be allowed in @safe code.

For example:

```d
@safe void func(int i, char* s)
{
    printf("i is %d\n", i);  // allowed
    printf("s is %s\n", s);  // unsafe, not allowed
}
```
