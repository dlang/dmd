Integers in `debug` or `version` statements have been removed from the language

These were deprecated in 2.101.
Use `-debug=identifier` and `-version=identifier` instead for versions set on the command line,
and likewise `version = identifier;` and `debug = identifier;` for versions set in code at global scope.
