OSX 32-bit is no longer supported

With this release, the DMD compiler will no longer officially support
building 32-bit applications for OSX. For legacy purposes, older releases
can be used.

$(B Motivation:) The latest macOS release $(I Majove) is the last version of OSX
with support for running 32-bit applications. The D development team wants to
focus its efforts and build/test infrastructure on active and important platforms.
