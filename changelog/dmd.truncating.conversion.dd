Implicit integer conversions in `int op= float` assignments has been deprecated

This is to prevent potential mistakes when `op=` assignment would implicitly
truncate the right hand side expression from a non-zero value to zero.
```
uint a;
float b = 0.1;
a += b; // Deprecation: `uint += float` is performing truncating conversion
```

The corrective action if truncating was intentional is to explicitly cast the
floating point expression to integer.
```
a += cast(uint) b;
```
