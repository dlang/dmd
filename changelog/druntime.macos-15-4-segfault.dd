Fixed generated binaries crashing on macOS 15.4

macOS 15.4 has introduced an undocumented ABI change to the format of
thread local variable section, which causes almost all executable built with
previous D compiler versions to crash during initialization, if they use
DRuntime. This release introduces a mitigation for this issue that is
backwards compatible with previous versions of macOS.
