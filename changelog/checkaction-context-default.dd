Enhanced `assert` informations are now printed by default

Starting from this release, DMD will now print rich informations on assert failures.
For example, the following code:
---
void main ()
{
    int a = 0, b = 42;
    assert(a == b);
}
---

Will now print: `core.exception.AssertError@filename.d(4): 0 != 42`.
This behavior was previously accessible via the CLI switch `-checkaction=context`.
To revert to the old behavior, use `-checkaction=D`.
