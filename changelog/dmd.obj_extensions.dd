Object file extensions `.o` and `.obj` are now accepted on all platforms

Accepting `.o` and `.obj` file extensions on all platforms makes DMD behave
like Clang and other modern compilers. There is no point in
discarding `*.o` or `*.obj` depending on the current operating system, as both extensions
unambiguously denote object file.
