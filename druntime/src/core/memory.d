/**
 * This module provides an interface to the garbage collector used by
 * applications written in the D programming language. It allows the
 * garbage collector in the runtime to be swapped without affecting
 * binary compatibility of applications.
 *
 * Using this module is not necessary in typical D code. It is mostly
 * useful when doing low-level _memory management.
 *
 * Notes_to_users:
 *
   $(OL
   $(LI The GC is a conservative mark-and-sweep collector. It only runs a
        collection cycle when an allocation is requested of it, never
        otherwise. Hence, if the program is not doing allocations,
        there will be no GC collection pauses. The pauses occur because
        all threads the GC knows about are halted so the threads' stacks
        and registers can be scanned for references to GC allocated data.
   )

   $(LI The GC does not know about threads that were created by directly calling
        the OS/C runtime thread creation APIs and D threads that were detached
        from the D runtime after creation.
        Such threads will not be paused for a GC collection, and the GC might not detect
        references to GC allocated data held by them. This can cause memory corruption.
        There are several ways to resolve this issue:
        $(OL
        $(LI Do not hold references to GC allocated data in such threads.)
        $(LI Register/unregister such data with calls to $(LREF addRoot)/$(LREF removeRoot) and
        $(LREF addRange)/$(LREF removeRange).)
        $(LI Maintain another reference to that same data in another thread that the
        GC does know about.)
        $(LI Disable GC collection cycles while that thread is active with $(LREF disable)/$(LREF enable).)
        $(LI Register the thread with the GC using $(REF thread_attachThis, core,thread,osthread)/$(REF thread_detachThis, core,thread,threadbase).)
        )
   )
   )
 *
 * Notes_to_implementors:
 * $(UL
 * $(LI On POSIX systems, the signals `SIGRTMIN` and `SIGRTMIN + 1` are reserved
 *   by this module for use in the garbage collector implementation.
 *   Typically, they will be used to stop and resume other threads
 *   when performing a collection, but an implementation may choose
 *   not to use this mechanism (or not stop the world at all, in the
 *   case of concurrent garbage collectors).)
 *
 * $(LI Registers, the stack, and any other _memory locations added through
 *   the $(D GC.$(LREF addRange)) function are always scanned conservatively.
 *   This means that even if a variable is e.g. of type $(D float),
 *   it will still be scanned for possible GC pointers. And, if the
 *   word-interpreted representation of the variable matches a GC-managed
 *   _memory block's address, that _memory block is considered live.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations are free to scan the non-root heap in a precise
 *   manner, so that fields of types like $(D float) will not be considered
 *   relevant when scanning the heap. Thus, casting a GC pointer to an
 *   integral type (e.g. $(D size_t)) and storing it in a field of that
 *   type inside the GC heap may mean that it will not be recognized
 *   if the _memory block was allocated with precise type info or with
 *   the $(D GC.BlkAttr.$(LREF NO_SCAN)) attribute.)
 *
 * $(LI Destructors will always be executed while other threads are
 *   active; that is, an implementation that stops the world must not
 *   execute destructors until the world has been resumed.)
 *
 * $(LI A destructor of an object must not access object references
 *   within the object. This means that an implementation is free to
 *   optimize based on this rule.)
 *
 * $(LI An implementation is free to perform heap compaction and copying
 *   so long as no valid GC pointers are invalidated in the process.
 *   However, _memory allocated with $(D GC.BlkAttr.$(LREF NO_MOVE)) must
 *   not be moved/copied.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations must support interior pointers. That is, if the
 *   only reference to a GC-managed _memory block points into the
 *   middle of the block rather than the beginning (for example), the
 *   GC must consider the _memory block live. The exception to this
 *   rule is when a _memory block is allocated with the
 *   $(D GC.BlkAttr.$(LREF NO_INTERIOR)) attribute; it is the user's
 *   responsibility to make sure such _memory blocks have a proper pointer
 *   to them when they should be considered live.)
 *
 * $(LI It is acceptable for an implementation to store bit flags into
 *   pointer values and GC-managed _memory blocks, so long as such a
 *   trick is not visible to the application. In practice, this means
 *   that only a stop-the-world collector can do this.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations are free to assume that GC pointers are only
 *   stored on word boundaries. Unaligned pointers may be ignored
 *   entirely.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations are free to run collections at any point. It is,
 *   however, recommendable to only do so when an allocation attempt
 *   happens and there is insufficient _memory available.)

/**
Destroys and then deallocates an object.

In detail, `__delete(x)` returns with no effect if `x` is `null`. Otherwise, it
performs the following actions in sequence:
$(UL
    $(LI
        Calls the destructor `~this()` for the object referred to by `x`
        (if `x` is a class or interface reference) or
        for the object pointed to by `x` (if `x` is a pointer to a `struct`).
        Arrays of structs call the destructor, if defined, for each element in the array.
        If no destructor is defined, this step has no effect.
    )
    $(LI
        Frees the memory allocated for `x`. If `x` is a reference to a class
        or interface, the memory allocated for the underlying instance is freed. If `x` is
        a pointer, the memory allocated for the pointed-to object is freed. If `x` is a
        built-in array, the memory allocated for the array is freed.
        If `x` does not refer to memory previously allocated with `new` (or the lower-level
        equivalents in the GC API), the behavior is undefined.
    )
    $(LI
        Lastly, `x` is set to `null`. Any attempt to read or write the freed memory via
        other references will result in undefined behavior.
    )
)

Note: Users should prefer $(REF1 destroy, object) to explicitly finalize objects,
and only resort to $(LREF __delete) when $(REF1 destroy, object)
wouldn't be a feasible option.

Params:
    x = aggregate object that should be destroyed

See_Also: $(REF1 destroy, object), $(LREF GC.free)

History:

The `delete` keyword allowed to free GC-allocated memory.
As this is inherently not `@safe`, it has been deprecated.
This function has been added to provide an easy transition from `delete`.
It performs the same functionality as the former `delete` keyword.
