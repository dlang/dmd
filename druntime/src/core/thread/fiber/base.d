/*
 * Documentation of Fiber internals:
 *
 * The main routines to implement when porting Fibers to new architectures are
 * fiber_switchContext and initStack. Some version constants have to be defined
 * for the new platform as well, search for "Fiber Platform Detection and Memory Allocation".
 *
 * Fibers are based on a concept called 'Context'. A Context describes the execution
 * state of a Fiber or main thread which is fully described by the stack, some
 * registers and a return address at which the Fiber/Thread should continue executing.
 * Please note that not only each Fiber has a Context, but each thread also has got a
 * Context which describes the threads stack and state. If you call Fiber fib; fib.call
 * the first time in a thread you switch from Threads Context into the Fibers Context.
 * If you call fib.yield in that Fiber you switch out of the Fibers context and back
 * into the Thread Context. (However, this is not always the case. You can call a Fiber
 * from within another Fiber, then you switch Contexts between the Fibers and the Thread
 * Context is not involved)
 *
 * In all current implementations the registers and the return address are actually
 * saved on a Contexts stack.
 *
 * The fiber_switchContext routine has got two parameters:
 * void** a:  This is the _location_ where we have to store the current stack pointer,
 *            the stack pointer of the currently executing Context (Fiber or Thread).
 * void*  b:  This is the pointer to the stack of the Context which we want to switch into.
 *            Note that we get the same pointer here as the one we stored into the void** a
 *            in a previous call to fiber_switchContext.
 *
 * In the simplest case, a fiber_switchContext rountine looks like this:
 * fiber_switchContext:
 *     push {return Address}
 *     push {registers}
 *     copy {stack pointer} into {location pointed to by a}
 *     //We have now switch to the stack of a different Context!
 *     copy {b} into {stack pointer}
 *     pop {registers}
 *     pop {return Address}
 *     jump to {return Address}
 *
 * The GC uses the value returned in parameter a to scan the Fibers stack. It scans from
 * the stack base to that value. As the GC dislikes false pointers we can actually optimize
 * this a little: By storing registers which can not contain references to memory managed
 * by the GC outside of the region marked by the stack base pointer and the stack pointer
 * saved in fiber_switchContext we can prevent the GC from scanning them.
 * Such registers are usually floating point registers and the return address. In order to
 * implement this, we return a modified stack pointer from fiber_switchContext. However,
 * we have to remember that when we restore the registers from the stack!
 *
 * --------------------------- <= Stack Base
 * |          Frame          | <= Many other stack frames
 * |          Frame          |
 * |-------------------------| <= The last stack frame. This one is created by fiber_switchContext
 * | registers with pointers |
 * |                         | <= Stack pointer. GC stops scanning here
 * |   return address        |
 * |floating point registers |
 * --------------------------- <= Real Stack End
 *
 * fiber_switchContext:
 *     push {registers with pointers}
 *     copy {stack pointer} into {location pointed to by a}
 *     push {return Address}
 *     push {Floating point registers}
 *     //We have now switch to the stack of a different Context!
 *     copy {b} into {stack pointer}
 *     //We now have to adjust the stack pointer to point to 'Real Stack End' so we can pop
 *     //the FP registers
 *     //+ or - depends on if your stack grows downwards or upwards
 *     {stack pointer} = {stack pointer} +- ({FPRegisters}.sizeof + {return address}.sizeof}
 *     pop {Floating point registers}
 *     pop {return Address}
 *     pop {registers with pointers}
 *     jump to {return Address}
 *
 * So the question now is which registers need to be saved? This depends on the specific
 * architecture ABI of course, but here are some general guidelines:
 * - If a register is callee-save (if the callee modifies the register it must saved and
 *   restored by the callee) it needs to be saved/restored in switchContext
 * - If a register is caller-save it needn't be saved/restored. (Calling fiber_switchContext
 *   is a function call and the compiler therefore already must save these registers before
 *   calling fiber_switchContext)
 * - Argument registers used for passing parameters to functions needn't be saved/restored
 * - The return register needn't be saved/restored (fiber_switchContext hasn't got a return type)
 * - All scratch registers needn't be saved/restored
 * - The link register usually needn't be saved/restored (but sometimes it must be cleared -
 *   see below for details)
 * - The frame pointer register - if it exists - is usually callee-save
 * - All current implementations do not save control registers
 *
 * What happens on the first switch into a Fiber? We never saved a state for this fiber before,
 * but the initial state is prepared in the initStack routine. (This routine will also be called
 * when a Fiber is being resetted). initStack must produce exactly the same stack layout as the
 * part of fiber_switchContext which saves the registers. Pay special attention to set the stack
 * pointer correctly if you use the GC optimization mentioned before. the return Address saved in
 * initStack must be the address of fiber_entrypoint.
 *
 * There's now a small but important difference between the first context switch into a fiber and
 * further context switches. On the first switch, Fiber.call is used and the returnAddress in
 * fiber_switchContext will point to fiber_entrypoint. The important thing here is that this jump
 * is a _function call_, we call fiber_entrypoint by jumping before it's function prologue. On later
 * calls, the user used yield() in a function, and therefore the return address points into a user
 * function, after the yield call. So here the jump in fiber_switchContext is a _function return_,
 * not a function call!
 *
 * The most important result of this is that on entering a function, i.e. fiber_entrypoint, we
 * would have to provide a return address / set the link register once fiber_entrypoint
 * returns. Now fiber_entrypoint does never return and therefore the actual value of the return
 * address / link register is never read/used and therefore doesn't matter. When fiber_switchContext
 * performs a _function return_ the value in the link register doesn't matter either.
 * However, the link register will still be saved to the stack in fiber_entrypoint and some
 * exception handling / stack unwinding code might read it from this stack location and crash.
 * The exact solution depends on your architecture, but see the ARM implementation for a way
 * to deal with this issue.
 *
 * The ARM implementation is meant to be used as a kind of documented example implementation.
 * Look there for a concrete example.
 *
 * FIXME: fiber_entrypoint might benefit from a @noreturn attribute, but D doesn't have one.
 */

/**
 * This class provides a cooperative concurrency mechanism integrated with the
 * threading and garbage collection functionality.  Calling a fiber may be
 * considered a blocking operation that returns when the fiber yields (via
 * Fiber.yield()).  Execution occurs within the context of the calling thread
 * so synchronization is not necessary to guarantee memory visibility so long
 * as the same thread calls the fiber each time.  Please note that there is no
 * requirement that a fiber be bound to one specific thread.  Rather, fibers
 * may be freely passed between threads so long as they are not currently
 * executing.  Like threads, a new fiber thread may be created using either
 * derivation or composition, as in the following example.
 *
 * Warning:
 * Status registers are not saved by the current implementations. This means
 * floating point exception status bits (overflow, divide by 0), rounding mode
 * and similar stuff is set per-thread, not per Fiber!
 *
 * Warning:
 * On ARM FPU registers are not saved if druntime was compiled as ARM_SoftFloat.
 * If such a build is used on a ARM_SoftFP system which actually has got a FPU
 * and other libraries are using the FPU registers (other code is compiled
 * as ARM_SoftFP) this can cause problems. Druntime must be compiled as
 * ARM_SoftFP in this case.
